## Work/Internship Experience

### Generative AI Intern - NCS Pte Ltd

Duration: Jan 2025 - Jun 2025

#### Developed LLM Chatbot Evaluator Platform

|C.A.R. Component|Raw Data Extracted|Competency & Action Verb|
|:--------------:|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Context|Addressed high risk of untrustworthy LLM output by developing a reliable, scalable human-in-the-loop evaluation method.|Anchors: Designed, Engineered, Prototyped, Validated, Strategized|
|Action| Developed a POC using Python's Haystack and Streamlit. Integrated novel generation logic (synthetic conversations) with user-defined objective and personas. Implemented an Evaluation pipeline using an RNN classification algorithm to categorize feedback and creates LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators. Final goal: generate a spider plot for SME decision-making.| Tools: Python, Haystack, Streamlit, RNN Classification; Collaboration: Interviewed and prototyped iterations with potential SME.|
|Results|Clinched First Place in the company-wide hackathon, "NEXT Ignite". Secured management commitment to allocate resources for productization. Platform projected to achieve 90% accuracy in evaluation within 5 iterations.|Metrics: 1st place in hackathon; Secured resources for product development|

#### Full-Stack Data Collection Application

|C.A.R. Component|Raw Data Extracted|Competency & Action Verb|
|:--------------:|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Context|Needed high-quality, critiqued data to develop and train the Evaluation step (RNN classifier) of the chatbot evaluator platform|Anchors: Developed, Managed, Coordinated, Collected|
|Action|Created a full-stack web application to display 100+ conversations for critique. Managed a team of 5 members who provided feedback/critiques|Tools: Full-stack development (Nextjs); Collaboration: Coordinated and managed data collection from a team of 5 members|
|Results|Successfully generated 200–300 pieces of high-quality, critiqued data for developing the RNN classifier POC|Metrics: 200–300 high-quality data points generated.|

#### Model Context Protocol Exploration and Utilities
|C.A.R. Component|Raw Data Extracted|Competency & Action Verb|
|:--------------:|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Context|Explored the potential of Model Context Protocol (MCP) for complex automation and code generation|Anchors: Explored, Automated, Documented, Integrated|
|Action|Used Python and Haystack to create a command line chatbot. Gave the chatbot controls to different MCP servers (e.g., Playwright and the file system). Used the CLI to write application documentation and simple test cases/web automation scripts. Wrote scripts to dynamically capture up-to-date screenshots for documentation.|Tools: Python, Haystack, Playwright MCP Observation: Demonstrated the ability to execute complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., website login with one prompt) via MCP|
|Results|Significantly increased the efficiency of documentation and testing by using the CLI chatbot for automated writing and test-case generation. Ensured documentation visuals were up-to-date.|Metrics: Increased documentation efficiency.|

#### Notable Achievements
1. NEXT Ignite Hackathon - Clinched First Place
2. NCS Intern AEIOU Awards (Adventure Category) - Runner Up

### Software Developer Intern - DNDTS Pte Ltd

Duration: May 2024 - Aug 2024

#### Multi-Barcode Recognition System

|C.A.R. Component|Raw Data Extracted|Competency & Action Verb|
|:--------------:|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Context|Full-stack Engineering & Computer Vision. Focused on process automation and efficiency.|Anchors: Engineered, Developed, Automating, Accelerated|
|Action|Developed a next.js mobile-web application integrated with roboflow barcode detection computer vision model. Implemented a pipeline to identify, crop, and decode multiple barcodes from a single image, automating updates to master spreadsheet.| Tools: Next.js, Roboflow; Context: Replaced manual infrared scanning.|
|Results|Reduced shipment processing time from 4 hours to under 2 hours. Enable staff unfamiliar with the process to execute high-volume shipments effectively.|Metrics: 50% efficiency increase; Time reduced by 2+ hours per shipment|

#### Customer Support RAG Application

|C.A.R. Component|Raw Data Extracted|Competency & Action Verb|
|:--------------:|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Context|System Architecture & Cost Reduction. Focused on knowledge retrieval and staff enablement.|Anchors: Architected, Deployed, Reduced, Generated|
|Action|Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using LangChain, ChromaDB and Streamlit. Containerized the solution using Docker for secure local network deployment. Conducted user research to ensure the LLM handled nuances within the 300 page handbook.| Tools: Langchain, ChromaDB, Streamlit, Docker; Context: Addressed high turnover and inconsistent responses.|
|Results|Generated $150,000 in annual saving by reducing support headcount requirements. Reduced new staff onboarding time by 60% (from 1 week to 2 days)|Metrics: $150k annual savings; 60% reduction in onboarding time.|

### Software Developer Intern - Kinexcs Pte Ltd

Duration: May 2023 - Aug 2023

#### Patient Recovery Report Generation

|Action|Integrated Chart.js for visual analytics and deployed the solution as serverless function on AWS Lambda.| Tools: AWS Lambda, Chart.js, Node.js; Context: Clinicians spent too much time comparing reports (10-15 minutes per report per patient).|
|Results|Reduced clinician analysis time from 15 minutes down to under 1 minute.|Metrics: 15x faster analysis for clinicians.|

#### Secure Clinic-Patient Referral System

|C.A.R. Component|Raw Data Extracted|Competency & Action Verb|
|:--------------:|:-----------------|:-----------------------|
|Context|Technical Decision Making & Optimization|Anchors: Evaluated, Mitigated, Analysed.|
|Action|Analyzed and Identified performance bottleneck in PDF generation caused by Headless Browsers. Refactored pipline to use Markdown and Pandoc for lightweight conversion.| Tools: Pandoc, Markdown, Node.js; Context: Generation of report was slow (1 min/report)|
|Results|Reduced report generation time by over 90%|Metrics: 90% reduction in generation time.|
