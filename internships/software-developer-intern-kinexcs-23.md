Software Developer Intern - Kinexcs

Duration: May 2023 - Aug 2023

Project 1: Patient Recovery Report Optimization
Developed a Comparison Report Generator that allowed physiotherapists to retrieve the four latest patient data points within a custom date range.
    Visual Analytics: Integrated Chart.js to visualize recovery trends, reducing the time clinicians spent manually comparing reports from 15 minutes to under 1 minute.
    Performance Engineering: Identified high latency in the existing "headless browser" PDF generation method (taking ~1 min per report).
    Optimization Strategy: Refactored the pipeline by migrating from HTML-heavy rendering to Markdown and utilizing Pandoc for PDF conversion.
    Results: Reduced report generation time by over 90%, bringing it down from 60 seconds to 3–5 seconds.
    Deployment: Deployed the optimized scripts as serverless functions using AWS Lambda.

Project 2: Secure Clinic-Patient Referral System
Contributed to a centralized dashboard, using React, facilitating secure patient transfers between different medical facilities.
    Data Amalgamation: Integrated data across 4 independent and geographically distributed systems, ensuring a unified view of patient recovery progress regardless of the clinic location.
    Security & Compliance: Developed a referral flow that kept sensitive patient data within the internal ecosystem, eliminating the need for unsafe external communication methods.
    Collaboration Tools: Built features allowing physiotherapists across clinics to communicate and share treatment insights, enhancing the continuity of care f

Key Skills & Technologies
    Cloud & DevOps: AWS Lambda (Serverless), Pandoc, Playwright
    Backend & Logic: Node.js (for Lambda)
    Frontend & Data Viz: HTML/CSS, Chart.js, React, ChakraUI

💡Lessons Learned
    Tool Selection Matters: Learned that while "Headless Browsers" (like Puppeteer or Selenium) are convenient for rendering, they carry heavy overhead. For high-performance document generation, Pandoc/Markdown is a much leaner and faster alternative.
    Cold Start Awareness: Gained experience with AWS Lambda cold starts, understanding how resource allocation and execution time impact the end-user experience in a serverless environment.
    Data Integrity in Distributed Systems: Recognized the complexity of syncing data across distributed clinics. Ensuring that a patient's recovery history remains consistent and accessible across different nodes is critical for medical accuracy and safety.

<!-- Task 1 - Implement Comparison Report Generator -->
<!-- For clinics to show their patients their recovery progress, they would have to pull out reports individually and manually compare these reports to come to a verdict about the patient's recovery. This process would usually take around 10 to 15 minutes. The task I had to fix was to come up with a comparison report where the doctor/physiotherapist can specify a range of date from which the 4 latest data regarding the patient is retrieved which will then be used to craft a graph using chartjs to show the trend about the patients recovery. This provided the doctor with the necessary insights within 1 minute. The design of the report was crafted by a designer and my job was to piece it together using HTML code and then turning it into PDF. After which, I start up a server using AWS lambda to run this report generation script. -->

<!-- Task 2 - Improve efficiency in generating reports -->
<!-- The normal report and comparison report are generated by starting up a serverless browser, rendering all the data on the browser, then using the print function in the browser to retrieve the pdf. However this process is extremely slow, taking up to 1 minute to generate. This coupled with AWS lambda function which also takes time to set up the resources on the cloud if not used for a prolong time means the generation of report just takes even longer. To address this issue, I refactor the code, using markdown as much as possible and only using html when required like plotting graph using chartjs. And instead of using a headless browser, I integrated pandoc to do the conversion from markdown to pdf instead. This helps to speed up the process from taking up to 1 minute to generate down to only 3-5 seconds instead. Then I deployed this pipeline to AWS lambda instead. -->

<!-- Task 3 - Dashboard for clinic-patient referral -->
<!-- The tech lead created a flow in which we can refer patients from one clinic to another clinic. This would ensure that the data stayed within our systems and the clinics does not have to resort to other ways in order to send patients information which could be unsafe. This also allows the almagamation of data across 4 independent and geographically distributed system. This allows either patients to be able to access their recovery progress data in different clinics or allow physiotherapist to communicate with each other on other ways to help the patient. -->
